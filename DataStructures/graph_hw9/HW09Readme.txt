Problem 1:
1. When the main function is run, will print out instructions for what keys to press.
2. When you press "G", automatically creates a sample graph and connects the edges. Refer to attachment "SampleGraph" to help visualize.
3. When you press "D", asks you to input both a source and target vertices index. Will then find the longest distance between source, target.
4. For example,if source is 0, target is 2, longest distance is 2, refer to attachment "SampleGraphDistance" to help visualize.

Problem 2:
1. Just need to press the "run" button, then console will print out path to get from source to target. Refers to file words.txt as examples.
